# JobHunter

Code for helping me in my search for Data Scientist jobs.

The primary aim of this program is to identify keywords (related to skills, both personal and technical) most used by recruiters in Data Science job listings using basic Natural Language Processing methods. The job listings will initially only be extracted from Indeed.com.

(Side aims:
* practice my Text Mining skills
* using version control becoming 2nd nature to me
* learn new programming skills (GUI etc...)
* procrastinate actually looking for jobs)

Future goals:
* expand to several different job websites (Monster, Glassdoor?, LinkedIn?)
* merge listings from the aforementioned websites to create a single ongoing list of job opportunities (using similarity measures to discard doubles)
* have program run automatically on my computer once/twice a day/upon launch
* generalise to all job searches/locations for potential users
* add a GUI
