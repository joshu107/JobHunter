# JobHunter

The primary aim of this program is to identify keywords (related to skills, both personal and technical) most used by recruiters in Data Science job listings using basic Natural Language Processing methods. The job listings will initially only be extracted from Indeed.com.

(Side aims:
* practice my Text Mining skills
* use version control so it becomes 2nd nature to me
* learn new, more "computer sciency" skills (GUI etc...)
* procrastinate actually looking for jobs)

Future goals:
* expand to several different job websites (Monster, Glassdoor?, LinkedIn?)
* merge listings from the aforementioned websites to create a single ongoing list of job opportunities (using similarity measures to discard doubles)
* have program run automatically on my computer once/twice a day/upon launch
* generalise to all job searches/locations for potential users
* add a GUI
* sell my software for a small fortune, retire at the tender age of 27, ironically never needing to JobHunt ever again
